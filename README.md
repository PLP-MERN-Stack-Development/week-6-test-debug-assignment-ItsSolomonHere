# Testing and Debugging MERN Applications

This assignment focuses on implementing comprehensive testing strategies for a MERN stack application, including unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing, along with debugging techniques.

## Assignment Overview

You will:
1. Set up testing environments for both client and server
2. Write unit tests for React components and server functions
3. Implement integration tests for API endpoints
4. Create end-to-end tests for critical user flows
5. Apply debugging techniques for common MERN stack issues

## Getting Started

1. Accept the GitHub Classroom assignment invitation
2. Clone your personal repository that was created by GitHub Classroom
3. Follow the setup instructions in the `Week6-Assignment.md` file
4. Explore the starter code and existing tests
5. Complete the tasks outlined in the assignment

## Files Included

- `Week6-Assignment.md`: Detailed assignment instructions
- Starter code for a MERN application with basic test setup:
  - Sample React components with test files
  - Express routes with test files
  - Jest and testing library configurations
  - Example tests for reference

## Requirements

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- MongoDB (local installation or Atlas account)
- npm or yarn
- Basic understanding of testing concepts

## Testing Tools

- Jest: JavaScript testing framework
- React Testing Library: Testing utilities for React
- Supertest: HTTP assertions for API testing
- Cypress/Playwright: End-to-end testing framework
- MongoDB Memory Server: In-memory MongoDB for testing

## ðŸ§ª Testing Scripts

### Client
- `npm test --prefix client` â€“ Run all client tests
- `npm run test:unit --prefix client` â€“ Run client unit tests
- `npm run test:integration --prefix client` â€“ Run client integration tests
- `npm run test:e2e --prefix client` â€“ Run Cypress E2E tests

### Server
- `npm test --prefix server` â€“ Run all server tests
- `npm run test:unit --prefix server` â€“ Run server unit tests
- `npm run test:integration --prefix server` â€“ Run server integration tests

### Install All Dependencies
- `npm install --prefix client && npm install --prefix server`

### Notes
- Make sure your development server is running for E2E tests.
- Adjust test scripts as needed for your workflow.

## Submission
